##Android app for wirelessly interacting with billboards

The app uses wireless billboards connected to iBeacons. The iBeacons transmit a basic image file and a link.
The link transmitted is used to make a Paypal link that is then used to make a purchase within the app.

The purpose is to make the process of buying things seamless. The app is entirely unobtrusive until the user wishes to buy something he sees on a billboard. Once he does, he simply needs to open the app, and a list of available products around him is presented. He can simply tap on any of these to purchase the item.

The bleepsample provided by rainmakerlabs for iBeacon development was used and developed on.
